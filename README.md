# CsvDemoApp
Currently the code assumes that csv files will not have any fixed columns, hence columns are taken dynamically on the basis of given input
The code currently sends SMS to itself by fetching the number through Telephony Manager.
The system currently operates in activities and if you take a look at log cat for errors (I usually use Log.e as its red and easier to keep track of), you will be able to see the outputs like random value generated for random functions etc.
The code is written in a limited time schedule and Im always up for improving and continously learning to build the best quality product.
